# nrf24-development-board

The goal of this repository is to keep a version of a useful development board for my 'mysensors projects' based on atmega 328 and nrf24l01 module, so I do not need to wire all componentes into a breadboard.

I also made almost all I/O pins available for direct connection in the board.

This is the way it looks like:
